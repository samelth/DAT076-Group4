Hi Robin,

Use case #11
Name: Total player count
Actor: User
Goal: See total player count
Description: As a user I would like to see how many players that ever joined a game

In this case, I decided to make visible a count of the amount of players who ever joined
a game. 

Frontend:
In the index.xhtml I added a text tag with some local CSS, and added a function call
to #{indexController.totalPlayerCount() at Line 60. 

Backend:
This in turn calls the function totalPlayerCount() located in the indexController.
The function simply returns the number of entries in the PLEB table located in the
GamesProd database with the help of the count() function located in AbstractDAO.

Since there wasn't much information to go on I'm not sure this will suffice. 
Get back to me if it doesn't, and if I need to make a more complex use case or
show you something else.
